# Journal Analysis
In this project, I analyzed 4.5+ years of journal entries using NLP in python to derive unique, data-driven insights about my life experience.

## Premise
Iâ€™ve been writing daily journals in google docs for the past four and a half years, but haven't ever had a chance to really look back on them. 4.5 years later there's way too many entries for me to read them all, so I instead looked at the text through code.

## Analysis
I used WordCloud to visualize my most common words for each year, giving me a brief refresher on my history. The words matched closely with my memory of those years. I then analyzed the polarity of my writing over time using TextBlob, and saw that 2020 was almost twice as positive as any other year. I was surprised how strongly the sentiment corresponded to my feelings; 2020 has been the happiest year of my life by far. Finally, I looked at the length of my journal entries over time, and visualizing length against polarity revealed some interesting insights.

The last thing I did was train a deep learning neural network on my journal text using fast.ai. I had the neural network generate sample journal entries based on various starting words, and it produced some eerily similar entries to how I write.
